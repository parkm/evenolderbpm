Tiled
    movers:
        walls will only move if the mover line goes past the wall's boundaries.
        if you go past the wall's width, the wall's right side will align to the line
        if you go before the wall's x, the wall's left side will align to the line
        vertical behavior should work the same way

        Only one mover per each moving wall
        The Wall ID is the mover's name in Tiled
        To wire a moving wall to a mover, they must have the same Type in Tiled
        all movement settings are specified in the mover
