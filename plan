    Rating ideas:
        Use the following format to rate ideas
        Spencer's Rating | Parker's Rating
        All ratings out of 9 (single digit is easier in vim)
        Example:
            9 | 0 - implement kitten raids
        When posing an idea, put unrated ratings as 'x'

        Rating value meanings (idea):
            <5 = Don't like it or don't want it in the game
                - give reasons in a comment like this
            5  = Maybe, possibly requires more description or discussion
                - also give reasons for this
            >5 = Like it, it should go into the final idea pile
                - No reasons necessary, but add comments if you want

        9 | 9 = automatic transfer to final area

    Important! - Need ideas for the following

    Game Ideas (Themes, etc. that affect overall game experience):
        8 | x - Elemental Bubbles and Chain Upgrades
            -S: I came up with this idea a few days ago and still really like it. So, some bubbles could have elemental abilities (which are unlocked via the spawner) like lightning, fire, and ice. Lightning could do a powerful chain reaction, fire could light other bubbles on fire and kill lit bubbles after an amount of time, ice could freeze bubbles in a surrounding area when popped.
                These elemental bubbles can be upgraded and upgrades could coincide with bigger and better combos related to elemental bubbles.
                    Examples
                    - Fire and Ice: Bubbles killed by flame have a 10% chance to freeze bubbles in the surrounding area
                    - Lightning of the Gods: 50% chance to chain lightning to all bubbles on screen
                    - Lightning Chain+: Increases the amount of bubbles in the lightning chain by one
                These element bubbles can have some kick ass effects.

                -P: Lightning and fire are essentially double and bomb bubbles. How about we just get rid of double and bomb and replace them with lightning fire. I'm also not sure about ice, why do you wanna freeze a bubble? There doesn't seem like much payoff compared to the others. If we do replace them, I'd like lightning to just create 2 pins (which we could show that are electrically charged), I don't like chain lightning when there's already an AoE. We could also make upgrades for lightning which would increase pin count, increase pin speed, etc

                    -S: Yeah, good point. I was also thinking the same thing about the AoE. I mostly like the idea of a distinction between physical damage and magical damage in relation to combos.
                        Ooh, what about this? So instead of the bubbles having magical properties, we just have the magical properties applied to the pins.
                        For example, an electric pin 

                Then, the other route is physical damage. In the physical damage route, you'd combine upgrades that affect the way pins damage bubbles and weapon upgrades.
                    Examples
                    - Shrapnel: Pins have a 25% chance to split in two after popping a bubble. (Like a double bubble - but this is a higher end upgrade)
                    - Exploding Pin: Pins have a 20% chance to explode
                    - Increase pin size: pins are bigger
                    - Shotgun: Unlocks shotgun weapon (combine with increase pin size, exploding pin or shrapnel for max damage)
                    - Flamethrower: No pins, just fire. Fiiiire.
                    - Cupcake Thrower: Throws cupcakes of DOOOM.

                    9 | x - We could even make it so you can only have x amount of upgrades active at one time. That'd be a fun mechanic. This would also include weapon upgrades.
                        -S: I REALLY like this mechanic. If not x upgrades active, then we could have a subset of abilities that work in that way.
                            This way, you unlock your abilities, then choose what abilities you want active. It will make the game less OP and more strategic (skill factor)

                -P: So would these be like talent trees? We could have the elemental and then damage trees.
                    -S: Eh, sorta. I don't want them to be trees, though. I'm thinking similar to the perks in Stick of Truth, how it's just a wall of upgrades, but you have to
                        strategically choose the upgrades that benefit from each other to form a psuedo talent tree. This would provide a skill factor for the game and make
                        it really fun. See the upgrades section for elaboration.


    Gameplay ideas:
        5 | 9 - Bubbles spawn from the corners
            - I think this might be too predictable and/or boring
                -P: So will they just appear randomly on the screen (probably will be animated if so), or will they come into view from outside?
                -S: Hmmm, good question. I think I like them appearing randomly more. We should do something that makes sense
                    and in the realm of physical possibility if possible. So, with that take on it, they should come into view from outside.
                    Let's do a vote. Add anything else you can think of.
                    7 | 5 - Come into view from outside
                        -P: Problem with this could be collisions. We'd have to disable collisions until the bubbles have arrived in the area.
                    6 | 6 - Appear Randomly with animation

        9 | 9 - Maybe you can be able to purchase certain bubbles:
                So one instance would be to purchase a bomb bubble when a bunch of them have spawned.
                - see bubble spawner upgrade
                7 | 9 - Start with only score bubbles?
                    -P: Yeah probably will make the other bubble spawners pretty cheap initially. So I think it'll start out with score, then double will be the next cheapest one, then combo, then bomb
                    -S: That sounds good. You can start that planning in the upgrade section.

        6 | 8 - Maybe get rid of bad bubbles entirely, since it's not a game about strategy
            - Let's hold off on officially deciding on this one for now

        7 | x - Walls will begin to spawn after a while.
            - Where will they spawn?
                - Based on an algorithm to determine a proper spot
                    a. declare what's not allowed, then it will fill in randomly
                    b. OR, we could make predefined levels in Tiled that transition (less cool)

                    -P: I very much prefer option b. We can also change bubble spawn points within each level which will give us greater control in level design. So i'm thinking that once you reach a certain point on the upgrades a new level will spawn and new upgrades which would accomodate that level. But a problem i'm seeing is with field upgrades like the auto shooter. What happens to those when a new level spawns? I'm kinda having second thoughts about walls.
                    -S: I agree; option a would probably be buggy as hell. What do you mean? I don't see any issues with the field upgrades. If anything, it makes it harder to idle, which is a good thing. It also makes shots harder to pull off, which increases the skill level - also a good thing. We can always implement different mechanics though.
                    -P: So let's say you have an auto shooter at x:5, y:5, then in one of the levels a wall is at that position. What happens to the auto shooter? Will it just be suffocated by the wall forever? Do we refund it?

        9 | 7 - Bonus Buffs: So when something triggers a bonus (not sure what will trigger a bonus though), a wheel will appear and give you a random buff for a limited time
            +50% gold
            +50% bubble spawn speed
            Infinite pins
            When a bubble pops it damages nearby bubbles

            -S: Bonuses should be triggered on level ups or other significant accomplishments (like super ultra mega combos). Love the idea though. We should make crazy "manic" animations and effects. I'd really like to stress the "Mania" part of the game and make it feel really arcade-like and Japanese-y.
            -P: Oh now that you brought that up. I think we should change the name. Google 'Bubble Pop Mania' and you'll see what I mean.

    Upgrade ideas:
        Sell tool: allows you to sell an auto shooter or any upgrade placed on the field.
        9 | 9 - Auto Shooter: When purchased use the mouse to place it on the map, then click, then use the mouse to set the angle, and click again. Shoots one pin on a certain interval.
            -S: Should you pre-set the angle or should it automatically choose (randomly or algorithmically?). I think it should shoot at random angles.
            9 | 9 - Auto Shooter Speed+
            8 | 5 - Auto Shooter Intelligence
                - Algorithmically determines the best angle to shoot, upgrades increase intelligence
                -P: Not sure, I think that if they will always change their angle to shoot, they should just spin in a circle and then shoot randomly. I also think the graphic for it should be circular so that we can have an upgrade which will allow it to shoot more than one pin, this would make it look less retarded if it were circle shaped. So yeah I think it should be random.

        9 | 9 - Bubble Spawner: one for each. Spawns a certain bubble on an interval.
            score: starts with it
            combo
            double
            bomb
            spawn speed+: for each type
            spawn count+: for each type

        6 | 6 - Pin Life+
            - I think there are better pin upgrades we can come up with. Perhaps pin life should be associated with the weapon?
            -P: Yeah I personally wouldn't want to upgrade pin life, seems boring. What do you mean weapon?


        8 | x - Abilities:
            Upgrade the following abilities. You can only have 3 (?) active abilities enabled at a time. Passive abilities are always enabled.

            Passive:
                Stuff like Bubble Spawner, Pin Life, Bubble Spawn Rate, etc.

            Active:
                (All brainstorming ideas)
                Electric Pins
                Fire Pins
                Immortal Pins
                Shrapnel Pins

            Weapons:
                Flamethrower
                Chicken Launcher
                Bubble Decimator

            Choose 1 weapon, 3 abilities, and all of your passive abilities to choose your "class". The fun part about this is that the combinations are limitless.
            We can plan out a bunch of different combinations, but also leave it open to let players find their own powerful combos.


    Bubble Types:


    Idle Ideas:
        x | 5 - Detect idling
        x | 5 - When idling:
            pins regen slower
            bubbles regen slower
            shooter shoots immediately when pins available
        -P: I don't think we need to do this. If you're not interacting with the game then that itself is already a great penalty.
        -S: What do you mean? How does idling start? Do you have to set it to idle before idling? This idea comes from the Anti Idle game.
        -P: The idling would happen naturally. The auto shooter would just keep shooting, and your buildings or whatever would generate income. The penalty for idling though is that you cannot use the main shooter. And the main shooter is way OP compared to the auto shooters.

        7 | 6 - Production buildings
            - Sort of as a side game, but implemented like cookie clicker
            -S: These production buildings could unlock the ability to unlock new upgrades. Like the technology tree in Civ.
            - ideas:
                1. Bubble-wrap Co.
                    a. produces bubble wrap, gives you $x per minute
                2. Bubble-wrap popping Co.
                    a. pops produced bubble wrap, gives you x pops per minute
                3. Maybe the Bubble Spawners could be buildings.
