=== New Gameplay Idea ===

    Rating ideas:
        Use the following format to rate ideas
        Spencer's Rating | Parker's Rating
        All ratings out of 9 (single digit is easier in vim)
        Example:
            9 | 0 - implement kitten raids
        When posing an idea, put unrated ratings as 'x'

        Rating value meanings (idea):
            <5 = Don't like it or don't want it in the game
                - give reasons in a comment like this
            5  = Maybe, possibly requires more description or discussion
                - also give reasons for this
            >5 = Like it, it should go into the final idea pile
                - No reasons necessary, but add comments if you want

    Important! - Need ideas for the following
        Mechanic that requires skill
            - Upgrade "combos"
                a. upgrades that benefit each other to unleash more power.
                b. requires strategy to pull off most efficient combos
        Focus (idle, action, etc)
            8 | x - Idle
        End game
            5 | 5 - Boss battle with bubble man
        Milestones
            - Upgrades

    Gameplay ideas:
        9 | x - Pins regenerate after certain time
        9 | x - Bubbles continuously respawn
        9 | x - Upgrades screen will always be present, may be able to toggle view

        8 | x - Maybe you can be able to purchase certain bubbles:
                So one instance would be to purchase a bomb bubble when a bunch of them have spawned.

        6 | x - Maybe get rid of bad bubbles entirely, since it's not a game about strategy
            - Let's hold off on officially deciding on this one for now

    Upgrade ideas:
        9 | x - Pin Storage+
        9 | x - Pin Regen Speed+
        9 | x - Pin Regen Amount+
        9 | x - Bubble Spawn Speed+
        9 | x - Bubble Max Count+

    Idle Ideas:
        Detect idling
        When idling:
            pins regen slower
            bubbles regen slower
            shooter shoots immediately when pins available

        7 | x - Production buildings
            - Sort of as a side game, but implemented like cookie clicker
            - ideas:
                1. Bubble-wrap Co.
                    a. produces bubble wrap, gives you $x per minute
                2. Bubble-wrap popping Co.
                    a. pops produced bubble wrap, gives you x pops per minute

    Things to consider:
        Boredom
        Replay value
        Interest (What makes me want to play this besides the gameplay?)
        Look and feel
        Skill Factor
