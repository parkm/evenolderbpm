    Upgrades:
        Pins+
        Bubbles+
            Remove Bad Bubbles

    Gameplay layout:
        Pop bubbles to get money
        Use money to purchase upgrades which help pop more bubbles, or whatever
        Repeat

=== New Gameplay Idea ===

    Rating ideas:
        Use the following format to rate ideas
        Spencer's Rating | Parker's Rating
        All ratings out of 10
        Example:
            10 | 0 - implement kitten raids
        When posing an idea, put unrated ratings as 'x'

    Important! - Need ideas for the following
        Mechanic that requires skill
        Focus (idle, action, etc)
        End game
            5 | x - Boss battle with bubble man
        Milestones

    Pins regenerate after certain time
    Bubbles continuously respawn
    Upgrades screen will always be present, may be able to toggle view

    Maybe you can be able to purchase certain bubbles:
        So one instance would be to purchase a bomb bubble when a bunch of them have spawned.

    Maybe get rid of bad bubbles entirely, since it's not a game about strategy

    Upgrades:
        Pin Storage+
        Pin Regen Speed+
        Pin Regen Amount+
        Bubble Spawn Speed+
        Bubble Max Count+

    Idle Ideas:
        Detect idling
        When idling:
            pins regen slower
            bubbles regen slower
            shooter shoots immediately when pins available

    Things to consider:
        Boredom
        Replay value
        Interest (What makes me want to play this besides the gameplay?)
        Look and feel
        Skill Factor
