=== New Gameplay Idea ===

    Rating ideas:
        Use the following format to rate ideas
        Spencer's Rating | Parker's Rating
        All ratings out of 10
        Example:
            10 | 0 - implement kitten raids
        When posing an idea, put unrated ratings as 'x'

        Rating value meanings (idea):
            <5 = Don't like it or don't want it in the game
            5  = Maybe, possibly requires more description or discussion
            >5 = Like it, it should go into the final idea pile

    Important! - Need ideas for the following
        Mechanic that requires skill
        Focus (idle, action, etc)
        End game
            5 | 5 - Boss battle with bubble man
        Milestones

    Gameplay ideas:
        x | x - Pins regenerate after certain time
        x | x - Bubbles continuously respawn
        x | x - Upgrades screen will always be present, may be able to toggle view

        x | x - Maybe you can be able to purchase certain bubbles:
                So one instance would be to purchase a bomb bubble when a bunch of them have spawned.

        x | x - Maybe get rid of bad bubbles entirely, since it's not a game about strategy

    Upgrade ideas:
        x | x - Pin Storage+
        x | x - Pin Regen Speed+
        x | x - Pin Regen Amount+
        x | x - Bubble Spawn Speed+
        x | x - Bubble Max Count+

    Idle Ideas:
        Detect idling
        When idling:
            pins regen slower
            bubbles regen slower
            shooter shoots immediately when pins available

    Things to consider:
        Boredom
        Replay value
        Interest (What makes me want to play this besides the gameplay?)
        Look and feel
        Skill Factor
