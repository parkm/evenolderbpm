=== New Gameplay Idea ===

    Rating ideas:
        Use the following format to rate ideas
        Spencer's Rating | Parker's Rating
        All ratings out of 9 (single digit is easier in vim)
        Example:
            9 | 0 - implement kitten raids
        When posing an idea, put unrated ratings as 'x'

        Rating value meanings (idea):
            <5 = Don't like it or don't want it in the game
                - give reasons in a comment like this
            5  = Maybe, possibly requires more description or discussion
                - also give reasons for this
            >5 = Like it, it should go into the final idea pile
                - No reasons necessary, but add comments if you want

        9 | 9 = automatic transfer to final area

    Important! - Need ideas for the following
        Mechanic that requires skill
            - Upgrade "combos"
                a. upgrades that benefit each other to unleash more power.
                b. requires strategy to pull off most efficient combos
        Focus (idle, action, etc)
            8 | 9 - Idle
        End game
            5 | 5 - Boss battle with bubble man
        Milestones
            - Upgrades

    Gameplay ideas:
        x | 9 - Bubbles spawn from the corners

        8 | 9 - Maybe you can be able to purchase certain bubbles:
                So one instance would be to purchase a bomb bubble when a bunch of them have spawned.
                - see bubble spawner upgrade

        6 | 8 - Maybe get rid of bad bubbles entirely, since it's not a game about strategy
            - Let's hold off on officially deciding on this one for now

        Walls will begin to spawn after a while.
            - Where will they spawn?

        x | 7 - Bonus Buffs: So when something triggers a bonus (not sure what will trigger a bonus though), a wheel will appear and give you a random buff for a limited time
            +50% gold
            +50% bubble spawn speed
            Infinite pins
            When a bubble pops it damages nearby bubbles

    Upgrade ideas:
        Sell tool: allows you to sell an auto shooter or any upgrade placed on the field.
        x | 9 - Auto Shooter: When purchased use the mouse to place it on the map, then click, then use the mouse to set the angle, and click again. Shoots one pin on a certain interval.
            x | 9 - Auto Shooter Speed+

        x | 9 - Bubble Spawner: one for each. Spawns a certain bubble on an interval.
            score: starts with it
            combo
            double
            bomb
            spawn speed+: for each type
            spawn count+: for each type

        x | 8 - Pin Life+

    Idle Ideas:
        x | 5 - Detect idling
        x | 5 - When idling:
            pins regen slower
            bubbles regen slower
            shooter shoots immediately when pins available
        - I don't think we need to do this. If you're not interacting with the game then that itself is already a great penalty.

        7 | 6 - Production buildings
            - Sort of as a side game, but implemented like cookie clicker
            - ideas:
                1. Bubble-wrap Co.
                    a. produces bubble wrap, gives you $x per minute
                2. Bubble-wrap popping Co.
                    a. pops produced bubble wrap, gives you x pops per minute
                3. Maybe the Bubble Spawners could be buildings.

    Things to consider:
        Boredom
        Replay value
        Interest (What makes me want to play this besides the gameplay?)
        Look and feel
        Skill Factor
