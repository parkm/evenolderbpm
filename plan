=== Current Gameplay ===

Bubble types:
    Score
    Bad
    Goal*
    Ammo*
    Double
    Combo
    Reflect*
    Bomb
    Action*

    *Probably not going to be used due to gameplay change

Upgrades:
    Pins+
    Bubbles+
        Remove Bad Bubbles

Gameplay layout:
    Pop bubbles to get money
    Use money to purchase upgrades which help pop more bubbles, or whatever
    Repeat

=== New Gameplay Idea ===

Pins regenerate after certain time
Bubbles continuously respawn
Upgrades screen will always be present, may be able to toggle view

Maybe you can be able to purchase certain bubbles:
    So one instance would be to purchase a bomb bubble when a bunch of them have spawned.

Maybe get rid of bad bubbles entirely, since it's not a game about strategy

Upgrades:
    Pin Storage+
    Pin Regen Speed+
    Pin Regen Amount+
    Bubble Spawn Speed+
    Bubble Max Count+

=== Other ===

Things to consider:
    Boredom
    Replay value
    Interest (What makes me want to play this besides the gameplay?)
    Look and feel
