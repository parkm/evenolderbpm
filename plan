    Rating ideas:
        Use the following format to rate ideas
        Spencer's Rating | Parker's Rating
        All ratings out of 9 (single digit is easier in vim)
        Example:
            9 | 0 - implement kitten raids
        When posing an idea, put unrated ratings as 'x'

        Rating value meanings (idea):
            <5 = Don't like it or don't want it in the game
                - give reasons in a comment like this
            5  = Maybe, possibly requires more description or discussion
                - also give reasons for this
            >5 = Like it, it should go into the final idea pile
                - No reasons necessary, but add comments if you want

        9 | 9 = automatic transfer to final area

    Game Ideas (Themes, etc. that affect overall game experience):

        8 | x - Elemental Bubbles and Chain Upgrades
            -S: I came up with this idea a few days ago and still really like it. So, some bubbles could have elemental abilities (which are unlocked via the spawner) like lightning, fire, and ice. Lightning could do a powerful chain reaction, fire could light other bubbles on fire and kill lit bubbles after an amount of time, ice could freeze bubbles in a surrounding area when popped.
                These elemental bubbles can be upgraded and upgrades could coincide with bigger and better combos related to elemental bubbles.
                    Examples
                    - Fire and Ice: Bubbles killed by flame have a 10% chance to freeze bubbles in the surrounding area
                    - Lightning of the Gods: 50% chance to chain lightning to all bubbles on screen
                    - Lightning Chain+: Increases the amount of bubbles in the lightning chain by one
                These element bubbles can have some kick ass effects.

                -P: Lightning and fire are essentially double and bomb bubbles. How about we just get rid of double and bomb and replace them with lightning fire. I'm also not sure about ice, why do you wanna freeze a bubble? There doesn't seem like much payoff compared to the others. If we do replace them, I'd like lightning to just create 2 pins (which we could show that are electrically charged), I don't like chain lightning when there's already an AoE. We could also make upgrades for lightning which would increase pin count, increase pin speed, etc

                    -S: Yeah, good point. I was also thinking the same thing about the AoE. I mostly like the idea of a distinction between physical damage and magical damage in relation to combos.
                        Ooh, what about this? So instead of the bubbles having magical properties, we just have the magical properties applied to the pins.
                        For example, an electric pin

                    -P: We need to figure out what they do though. What does a magical pin do that a normal pin doesn't? Same with bubbles.

                Then, the other route is physical damage. In the physical damage route, you'd combine upgrades that affect the way pins damage bubbles and weapon upgrades.
                    Examples
                    - Shrapnel: Pins have a 25% chance to split in two after popping a bubble. (Like a double bubble - but this is a higher end upgrade)
                    - Exploding Pin: Pins have a 20% chance to explode
                    - Increase pin size: pins are bigger
                    - Shotgun: Unlocks shotgun weapon (combine with increase pin size, exploding pin or shrapnel for max damage)
                    - Flamethrower: No pins, just fire. Fiiiire.
                    - Cupcake Thrower: Throws cupcakes of DOOOM.

                    9 | x - We could even make it so you can only have x amount of upgrades active at one time. That'd be a fun mechanic. This would also include weapon upgrades.
                        -S: I REALLY like this mechanic. If not x upgrades active, then we could have a subset of abilities that work in that way.
                            This way, you unlock your abilities, then choose what abilities you want active. It will make the game less OP and more strategic (skill factor)

                -P: So would these be like talent trees? We could have the elemental and then damage trees.
                    -S: Eh, sorta. I don't want them to be trees, though. I'm thinking similar to the perks in Stick of Truth, how it's just a wall of upgrades, but you have to strategically choose the upgrades that benefit from each other to form a psuedo talent tree. This would provide a skill factor for the game and make it really fun. See the upgrades section for elaboration.
                    -P: Problem with that though is you can't make really strong upgrades. They all have to be pretty much equal.

    Gameplay ideas:
        5 | 9 - Bubbles spawn from the corners
            - I think this might be too predictable and/or boring
                -P: So will they just appear randomly on the screen (probably will be animated if so), or will they come into view from outside?
                -S: Hmmm, good question. I think I like them appearing randomly more. We should do something that makes sense
                    and in the realm of physical possibility if possible. So, with that take on it, they should come into view from outside.
                    Let's do a vote. Add anything else you can think of.
                    7 | 5 - Come into view from outside
                        -P: Problem with this could be collisions. We'd have to disable collisions until the bubbles have arrived in the area.
                        -S: Speaking of which, should bubbles even collide with each other? These minor details are annoying :P but at the same time, they bring up
                            ideas that we would never have thought of before.
                        -P: I think we've talked about that before. I believe the reason for not having bubble collision was that the performance would be intense. There's going to be a ton of bubbles on screen.
                    6 | 6 - Appear Randomly with animation

        9 | 9 - Maybe you can be able to purchase certain bubbles:
                So one instance would be to purchase a bomb bubble when a bunch of them have spawned.
                - see bubble spawner upgrade
                7 | 9 - Start with only score bubbles?
                    -P: Yeah probably will make the other bubble spawners pretty cheap initially. So I think it'll start out with score, then double will be the next cheapest one, then combo, then bomb
                    -S: That sounds good. You can start that planning in the upgrade section.

        8 | 8 - Maybe get rid of bad bubbles entirely, since it's not a game about strategy
            - Let's hold off on officially deciding on this one for now
            -S: liking this idea more now

        5 | 5 - Walls will begin to spawn after a while.
            - Where will they spawn?
                - Based on an algorithm to determine a proper spot
                    a. declare what's not allowed, then it will fill in randomly
                    b. OR, we could make predefined levels in Tiled that transition (less cool)

                    -P: I very much prefer option b. We can also change bubble spawn points within each level which will give us greater control in level design. So i'm thinking that once you reach a certain point on the upgrades a new level will spawn and new upgrades which would accomodate that level. But a problem i'm seeing is with field upgrades like the auto shooter. What happens to those when a new level spawns? I'm kinda having second thoughts about walls.
                    -S: I agree; option a would probably be buggy as hell. What do you mean? I don't see any issues with the field upgrades. If anything, it makes it harder to idle, which is a good thing. It also makes shots harder to pull off, which increases the skill level - also a good thing. We can always implement different mechanics though.
                    -P: So let's say you have an auto shooter at x:5, y:5, then in one of the levels a wall is at that position. What happens to the auto shooter? Will it just be suffocated by the wall forever? Do we refund it?
                    -S: Yeah, I wasn't really understanding how you were picturing auto shooters. (See my reply in the Upgrade ideas -> Sell Tool section) Walls aren't a huge priority, so let's hold off on this until we plan other parts of the game. Dropped my rating to 5.

        9 | 7 - Bonus Buffs: So when something triggers a bonus (not sure what will trigger a bonus though), a wheel will appear and give you a random buff for a limited time
            +50% gold
            +50% bubble spawn speed
            Infinite pins
            When a bubble pops it damages nearby bubbles

            They are triggered when:
                ...

            -S: Bonuses should be triggered on level ups or other significant accomplishments (like super ultra mega combos). Love the idea though. We should make crazy "manic" animations and effects. I'd really like to stress the "Mania" part of the game and make it feel really arcade-like and Japanese-y.
            -P: Oh now that you brought that up. I think we should change the name. Google 'Bubble Pop Mania' and you'll see what I mean.
            -S: LOL. Yes, I agree. Adding name section to this plan. I still like this idea though.
            -P: Okay I'll add it to the final gameplay area when we've come up with how exactly they get triggered.

    Upgrade ideas:
        Sell tool: allows you to sell an auto shooter or any upgrade placed on the field.
            -S: Are Auto Shooters objects that you place on the field in addition to the main shooter or is it a unique weapon to act as a replacement?
            -P: Auto shooters would be new objects, they wouldn't replace the main shooter.
        9 | 9 - Auto Shooter: When purchased use the mouse to place it on the map, then click, then use the mouse to set the angle, and click again. Shoots one pin on a certain interval.
            -S: Should you pre-set the angle or should it automatically choose (randomly or algorithmically?). I think it should shoot at random angles.
            9 | 9 - Auto Shooter Speed+
            8 | 2 - Auto Shooter Intelligence
                - Algorithmically determines the best angle to shoot, upgrades increase intelligence
                -P: Not sure, I think that if they will always change their angle to shoot, they should just spin in a circle and then shoot randomly. I also think the graphic for it should be circular so that we can have an upgrade which will allow it to shoot more than one pin, this would make it look less retarded if it were circle shaped. So yeah I think it should be random.
                -S: Alrighty, mark your rating lower if you wanna drop it or keep it at a 5 if you wanna reconsider it later.

        9 | 9 - Bubble Spawner: one for each. Spawns a certain bubble on an interval.
            score: starts with it
            combo
            double
            bomb
            spawn speed+: for each type
            spawn count+: for each type

        6 | 6 - Pin Life+
            - I think there are better pin upgrades we can come up with. Perhaps pin life should be associated with the weapon?
            -P: Yeah I personally wouldn't want to upgrade pin life, seems boring. What do you mean weapon?
            -S: See the upgrade section for elaboration on the weapon idea.

        8 | 5 - Abilities:
            Upgrade the following abilities. You can only have 3 (?) active abilities enabled at a time. Passive abilities are always enabled.

            Passive:
                Stuff like Bubble Spawner, Pin Life, Bubble Spawn Rate, etc.

            Active:
                (All brainstorming ideas)
                Electric Pins
                Fire Pins
                Immortal Pins
                Shrapnel Pins

            Weapons:
                - Switch out your boring old pin shooter for upgraded awesomeness! Weapons provide various perks, like not shooting pins, but lasers or fire.
                - Unlocked through building upgrades (various weapons factories or something). See idling->buildings for details.
                - Combine the weapons mechanic with the pin abilities for max combo craziness.
                Flamethrower
                Chicken Launcher
                Bubble Decimator

                -P: What do these do though? So the weapon is the shooter?

            Choose 1 weapon, 3 abilities, and all of your passive abilities to choose your "class". The fun part about this is that the combinations are limitless.
            We can plan out a bunch of different combinations, but also leave it open to let players find their own powerful combos.

            -P: This is all a bit too vague. Come up with an example of how one of these combinations would work and what exactly they'd be improving.

    Bubble Types:
        Score
        Double
        Combo

        x | 5 -S:What about the other ones we came up with?
            -Iron
            -Ghost
            -P: These are more for levels. Remember that each thing we have to introduce to the player in an intuitive manner, so we don't want too much. But if we end up having that level thing then maybe we could add these.

    Resource limitations:
        -S: How are we going to handle resources? Just amount of pins? How do you get more pins? What if we made it so you have to buy pins using the currency obtained through popping bubbles and buildings. We could also have an upgrade to auto-buy pins when you run out. Of course, we'd make it easy to restock your pins. Any other resource restraints?
        -P: Pins should regen over time so we can have that upgrade available.

    Idle Ideas:
        0 | 5 - Detect idling
        0 | 5 - When idling:
            pins regen slower
            bubbles regen slower
            shooter shoots immediately when pins available
        -P: I don't think we need to do this. If you're not interacting with the game then that itself is already a great penalty.
        -S: What do you mean? How does idling start? Do you have to set it to idle before idling? This idea comes from the Anti Idle game.
        -P: The idling would happen naturally. The auto shooter would just keep shooting, and your buildings or whatever would generate income. The penalty for idling though is that you cannot use the main shooter. And the main shooter is way OP compared to the auto shooters.
        -S: Alright, that works. We'll just use the specs of the auto shooter to balance out the game. Idling needs a HEAVY penalty.

        8 | 6 - Production buildings
            - Sort of as a side game, but implemented like cookie clicker
            -S: These production buildings could unlock the ability to unlock new upgrades. Like the technology tree in Civ.
            -P: How would that work though? You just buy the building then you unlock the upgrade? Also how do buildings work in Cookie Clicker? Do they just give you more production? I think buildings are more for the idle part of the game.
            - ideas:
                1. Bubble-wrap Co.
                    a. produces bubble wrap, gives you $x per minute
                2. Bubble-wrap popping Co.
                    a. pops produced bubble wrap, gives you x pops per minute
                3. Maybe the Bubble Spawners could be buildings.
                4. Weapon factories to unlock new weapons
                5. Science labs to unlock new elemental pin upgrades (lightning, fire, etc)
                6. Manufacturing plants to unlock new physical pin upgrades (shrapnel, etc)


    UI Layout:
        Initial Menu (when game is first loaded)
            3 save slots, pick an empty one to start a new game, or pick an existing save
            Settings

        During Game
            Small bar UI (like existing UI, but let's keep it as minimal as possible)
            'Shop' Button
                Opens 30% transparent, black overlay window
                game continues to play in background

=== New Gamplay Final ===

    Gameplay:
        Pins regenerate after certain time
        Bubbles continuously respawn
        Upgrades screen will always be present, may be able to toggle view

        Score bubbles will be called bubbles. Double, combo, bomb bubbles will either be removed or be something different.
            Bubbles will continually arm themselves with stronger armor throughout the game.
                wood, stone, steel, black iron (just black steel), gold, platinum, diamond
            Bubbles will eventually (either from a large amount of bubbles or a time based pattern) summon a large boss bubble to help them. This will be integrated into the story.

        Elemental psuedo-classes
            Once bubbles start arming themselves elemental classes will start to be available
            You choose a weapon ability (this gets triggered when you shoot a pin, or basically when you click )
            a pin element (a bonus effect that happens when a pin either pops a bubble or collides with it)
            and an x amount of passive abilities

            and possibly additional upgrades for each thing.

            A more in depth explanation of the abilities should be discussed after hp bubbles have been fully designed and approved.

    Upgrades:
        Pin Storage+
        Pin Regen Speed+
        Pin Regen Amount+
        Bubble Spawn Speed+
        Bubble Max Count+
