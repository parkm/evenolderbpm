        If walls need to be used in code, add property 'id'
        If walls need to move, use polylines, use the same id in polyline as the moving wall
            - in the polyline object, use the polyline properties to move the wall.

    Destroy pins if they are smashed between two moving walls.

Other {
    Implement original gameplay for the 'Classic' game mode. (Might wanna do this after upgrade ui is finished) {
        Classic round will start with score/bad bubbles. You can buy
        new bubbles in the upgrade store and upgrade their spawn rate.
        All bubbles will also be frozen.

        Upgrades:
            Bomb bubbles
                Bomb bubble increase

            Ammo bubbles
                Ammo bubble increase
            
            Score bubble increase
            Bad bubble decrease
            Double bubble increase
            Combo bubble increase
            Pin count increase
            Pin life increase

# Ideas:

State.addRound {
    Put all of the xml loading code that's currently in State.create("game",...) in it's inner State.create callback.
        Pros: This would simplify the game parent state. The better abstraction would be useful when constructing new stuff in the round.
        Cons: the only way to create a level from editor data would be to use State.addRound.
        - Still deciding on this... I think we'll leave it as is. Leaving this here just in case.
